# Remote-Controlled-Liquid-Filler
It was one of the successful projects displayed on BBC Burmese <code>https://youtu.be/Vs6lDYDOak4?si=wyd7MCIrcl4F-ZTM</code>. The project was launched during the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020 by a school organization, "The Laboratory Of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (LORA)", located at Yangon Technological University. 

Our goal was to create a four-wheel vehicle to carry chemical disinfectants and refill sprayer vehicle(s) with a dispenser. We hoped such an invention would help health workers to access infected areas remotely. The project was called "Refiller Robot". It had two main parts:
1. Car (Mothership)
2. Remote

The car is capable of carrying heavy weight. Its frames are made with acrylic and custom 3D printing designs. It is controlled by the custom remote through radio waves. The remote has an LCD, LEDs, buttons, and a joystick.

The code encloses 
- Data transmission and receiving through radio modules
- Displaying interactions with LCD
- Getting the LIPO battery info to know when to recharge
- Driving the car with shifting speeds
- DC control for dispenser to start or stop filling liquid
