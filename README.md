# Remote-Controlled-Water-Filler
These are from the big projects of our organization LORA during the first wave COVID era. Our team created a four-wheel vehicle. The aim was to spray and refill chemical disinfectants (with a dispenser) without humans in important areas.

The project involves two parts
- Car (Mothership)
- Remote

The car, capable of carrying heavy weight, is controlled by the remote through radio waves. The remote has an LCD, a few LEDs, buttons, and a joystick.

The code encloses 
- Data transmission and receiving through radio modules
- Displaying interactions with LCD
- Getting the LIPO battery percentage to know when to recharge
- Driving the car with acceleratable speed
- DC control for dispenser to start or stop filling liquid
